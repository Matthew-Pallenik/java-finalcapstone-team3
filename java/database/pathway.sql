Because technology is such an in-demand field, companies will often work with outside recruiting agencies to assist them with finding individuals for their roles. There are several well-known agencies that your Pathway Team will recommend working with once you begin your job search, but as a best practice, you should have a relationship with at least 2-3 recruiters when you are actively looking. There are efficient ways, such as LinkedIn to get in touch with recruiters. It is important to share MOATS: Money (Your salary and/or hourly wage goals), Opportunities (What kind of roles you are interested in), Area (How far you are willing to commute), Timing (When you can work), Skills(Important tech skills) ',
