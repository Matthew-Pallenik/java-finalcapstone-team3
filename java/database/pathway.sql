'Working With Recruiters',

'As you begin your job search for a job in technology, you will find that it is not uncommon to work with third party recruiters for roles. Because technology is such an in-demand field, companies will often work with outside recruiting agencies to assist them with finding individuals for their roles. There are several well-known agencies that your Pathway Team will recommend working with once you begin your job search, but as a best practice, you should have a relationship with at least 2-3 recruiters when you are actively looking. There are efficient ways, such as LinkedIn to get in touch with recruiters. It is important to share MOATS: Money (Your salary and/or hourly wage goals), Opportunities (What kind of roles you are interested in), Area (How far you are willing to commute), Timing (When you can work), Skills(Important tech skills) ',

Track activities like meetups, podcasts, and self-studying additional coding languages. Incomplete projects still offer valuable experiencesâ€”employers want insights into your design process, encountered roadblocks, alternative approaches, and future plans for the project.

'Behavioral Interviews',

'Behavioral interviews are a more in-depth assessment of a candidate. Behavioral interviews are a structured interview technique used by hiring managers and HR professionals where they request information about a candidates past behavior in order to predict future behavior.  Behavioral interviews include a variety of open ended questions that will request context about a candidates specific past experience (key word: specific). The idea is that behavioral interview questions will force interviewees to give objective, real-life answers as opposed to telling the interviewer what they think they want to hear. Example behavioral questions may be: "Tell me about a time you failed", "Tell me about a time you ___ ". An efficient way to respond to these questions is by using Situation Task Action Result, or STAR stories for short.',
